## Overview
To setup your own blog just follow the instructions at [GitHub pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). 

I followed the tutorial myself to create `Andr√©'s Blog`, the blog you are reading right now. In less than an hour you will get:

- Your own blog
- A static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Free hosting with GitHub pages

And you will learn to write content for Jekyll with:
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
- [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
- [Jekyll Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
- [Blog Source Code](https://github.com/sw2go/blog)

## To create a new post
Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder and open it 
~~~
2023-01-06-how-to-xyz.md
~~~
Always insert a `front matter` section at the beginning.
~~~
---
layout: post
title: How to XYZ
date: 2023-01-06
published: true
---
~~~
Add your content in `markdown` syntax below. 
~~~
# How to xyz
lorem ipsum ..
~~~

## To create a new page
Create a new markdown file i.e. `projects.md` in the `root` folder and insert a slightly different `front matter` section.
~~~
---
layout: page
title: Projects
---
~~~
Then extend the `header_pages` section in `_config.yml`.
~~~
header_pages:
  - projects.md
  - about.md
~~~

## Jekyll minima dark theme
Edit `_config.yml` and replace `theme: minima` with `remote_theme: jekyll/minima` and set skin to dark.
~~~
remote_theme: jekyll/minima
minima:
  skin: dark
~~~

## Jekyll minima variables
I did not find a complete list of the variables you can use in Jekyll minima. The best way is to check the files in the [minima repository](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master). As an example, if you look at `minima/_layouts/home.html` one can see that if a `title` is defined on the page it will be displayed.

~~~
{% raw %}{%- if page.title -%}
  <h1 class="page-heading">{{ page.title }}</h1>
{%- endif -%}{% endraw %}
~~~

## To change minima default footer layout
Create a `_includes` folder and copy the `footer.html` from [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) into it. Then edit `footer.html` as you like.
