To setup your own blog just follow the instructions at [GitHub pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). 

I followed the tutorial myself to create `Andr√©'s Blog`, the blog you are reading right now. In less than an hour you will get:

- Your own blog
- A static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Free hosting with GitHub pages
