To setup your own blog just follow the instructions from [github-pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). 

I followed the tutorial myself to create `Andr√©'s Blog`, the blog you are reading right now. 

## What you get
- Your own blog
- It is a static website generated by [Jekill](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Free hosting with GitHub pages
