To setup your own blog just follow the instructions at [GitHub pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). 

I followed the tutorial myself to create `Andr√©'s Blog`, the blog you are reading right now. In less than an hour you will get:

- Your own blog
- A static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Free hosting with GitHub pages

And you will learn to write content for Jekyll with:
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
- [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
- [Blog Source Code](https://github.com/sw2go/blog)
