## Overview
To setup your own blog just follow the instructions at [GitHub pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). 

I followed the tutorial myself to create `Andr√©'s Blog`, the blog you are reading right now. In less than an hour you will get:

- Your own blog
- A static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Free hosting with GitHub pages

And you will learn to write content for Jekyll with:
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
- [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
- [Jekyll Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
- [Blog Source Code](https://github.com/sw2go/blog)

## To create a new post

Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder and open it 
~~~
2023-01-06-how-to-xyz.md
~~~
Enter a front matter section ...
~~~
---
layout: post
title: How to XYZ
date: 2023-01-06
published: true

~~~
... then write your content 
~~~
# How to xyz
lorem ipsum ..

## Jekyll minima variables
I did not find a complete list of the variables you can use in Jekyll minima. The best way is to check the files in the [minima repository](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master). As an example, if you look at `minima/_layouts/home.html` one can see that if a `title` is defined on the page it will be displayed.

~~~
{% raw %}
{%- if page.title -%}
  <h1 class="page-heading">{{ page.title }}</h1>
{%- endif -%} 
{% endraw %}
~~~

## To change minima default footer layout
Create a `_includes` folder and copy the `footer.html` from [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) into it. Then edit `footer.html` as you like.
